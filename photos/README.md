#### New Logo

![](2010/logo.png)

From @fuzyll:

> yeah, that’s the one that i had my girlfriend (now wife) draw for me. when i took over the club in early 2010, i didn’t even know we _had_ a logo - the old one (which is the slack icon) wasn’t really “in use” anymore (we only had 4 people left in the club by then lol)
> so, in an effort to get more people into the club, i came up with an entirely new branding for it and printed fliers and gave pitches in comp sci classes trying to get more people to show up
> as i recall it, one of the former members of the club (might’ve been @hoju, actually?) pointed out that we _did_ have a logo and gave me the `.bmp` file
and i went back to using that one for CTFs

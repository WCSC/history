# Whitehatters Computer Security Club History


## Inspiration and Validity Disclaimer

The effort to record WCSC history began in 2019 by Kevin Orr, inspired by the passing of Joe Rogers. 

Due to the late start, there are many gaps in our knowledge. Significant effort was put into verifying the accuracy of the following, but it cannot be guranteed. If you have information on WCSC's past, please submit a pull request or message one of the current EBoard members.

20:53 < hoju> so here's a story for all you kiddies about Xbox Live
20:55 < hoju> once there was a gullible moron named Hoju that set up his HTPC with XBMC... and used the Windows Media Center Remote IR mappings to do it.  One night, when he's using his HTPC for the first time in ages, he noticies that it has inadvertently turned on the Xbox with the IR codes for the HTPC.
20:55 < hoju> Not thinking much about it, he turns the xbox off from the power button up front and goes to bed.
20:56 < hoju> Two days later, he has $75 charged to his credit card for 6000 microsoft points from Xbox Live
20:56 < hoju> And his avatar is now dressed as a Banana
20:57 < hoju> Unfortunately, because Xbox Live does not refund microsoft point bundles after part of the balance has been used (ie banana)
20:57 < hoju> Little Hoju has 5600 microsoft points and is out $75
20:59 < hoju> As far fetched as it sounds, I received the email confirming the 6000 points at the exact time I was doing stuff to my HTPC.
21:00 < hoju> So if you're going to use a HTPC that uses Microsoft Media Center's IR mappings, AND an Xbox in the same vicinity... please for the love of God, change your Xbox preferences to allow ONLY XBOX MEDIA REMOTES to be able to control it.
21:01 < hoju> Otherwise you're out $75 and your avatar becomes dressed as a banana with a cat following it.
21:06 < hoju> frustrating
21:07 < hoju> fucking xbox wasnt budging 40 mins on the phone
